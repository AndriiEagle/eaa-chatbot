## 🛡️ Current Security Measures

### Application Security
- ✅ All user input validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ SQL injection protection with parameterized queries
- ✅ XSS protection with content sanitization
- ✅ CSRF protection with tokens
- ✅ Rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks
- ✅ Security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- ✅ Input length limitations
- ✅ File upload restrictions and validation

### API Security
- ✅ Authentication required for all sensitive endpoints
- ✅ API key rotation and management
- ✅ Request validation and sanitization
- ✅ Response data filtering
- ✅ Error message sanitization (no internal data leakage)
- ✅ Logging and monitoring of all API requests

### Data Protection
- ✅ Environment variables for all secrets (.env)
- ✅ API keys never logged or exposed in responses
- ✅ User data anonymization where possible
- ✅ No sensitive data in client-side code
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement for all communications
- ✅ Database encryption at rest
- ✅ Regular backup encryption

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Regular dependency updates
- ✅ Security scanning of all dependencies
- ✅ Container security best practices
- ✅ Network security and firewall configuration
- ✅ Regular security audits and penetration testing

## 🔧 Security Recommendations

### For Developers

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# NEVER commit these to Git
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co

# Always use .env files and add to .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

**Code Security:**
```typescript
// Always validate input
const schema = z.object({
  question: z.string().min(1).max(1000),
  userId: z.string().uuid(),
});

// Use parameterized queries
const result = await supabase
  .from('documents')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', userId); // Safe from SQL injection
```

### For Users

- Always use the latest version of EAA ChatBot
- Report suspicious behavior immediately
- Don't share your API keys or credentials
- Use strong passwords for your accounts
- Enable two-factor authentication where available

### For System Administrators

**Production Deployment:**
```bash
# Set secure environment
NODE_ENV=production

# Use HTTPS only
FORCE_HTTPS=true

# Set security headers
SECURITY_HEADERS=true

# Enable rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
```

**Monitoring:**
- Enable application logging
- Set up security event alerts
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
- Regular security scans and updates

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are **NOT** considered security vulnerabilities:

- Lack of features (feature requests go to regular issues)
- Issues in dependencies (report to dependency maintainers first)
- Social engineering attacks
- Spam or abuse of the service
- Performance issues not related to security
- Issues in third-party integrations (OpenAI, Supabase)

Before each release, we verify:

- [ ] All dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] No secrets or API keys in code
- [ ] All user inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] Security headers properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled and tested
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Database queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] Authentication and authorization working correctly
- [ ] Logging configured without sensitive data
- [ ] HTTPS enforced everywhere
